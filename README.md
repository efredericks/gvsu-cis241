## Assignments

All assignments are due by 11:59pm on the date they are due.  Please check Blackboard regularly for upcoming due dates.  If you are struggling or are having problems, please contact me in advance.  If you message me or email me the night something is due I will most likely not accept your reasoning.  If you get in touch early then we can work it out.
